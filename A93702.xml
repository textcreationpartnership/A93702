            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:115723:5"/> Party being ſuch, as would dwell upon a forme, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being contrary to all forme, running themſelves into a Chaos of confuſions, their diſtempered ſpirits, being utterly voyd of all order, or decency, ſo that it is as impoſſible for theſe two extreames, to unite into one, as Hell, and Heaven; I have therefore (by Divine aſſiſtance,) attained to the diſcovery of the Golden Meane, by which they may not only be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, but alſo brought to practiſe <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> according to the will, and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt in his Word; which thing is the now grand deſigne of Chriſt, therefore it behooves you, to ſtirre up theſe two parties, to comply with this revealed inſuing Truth, which though it be as yet deſpicable, yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Right Honourable, the Cloud doth now remove, and you are by providence brought even to the brinke of that River, through which you muſt paſſe, or you will never enter the Holy Land; take courage therefore right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, by conſidering what the Lord hath done for you, and how he hath to that very purpoſe, purged you, both from the Epiſcopall, and Presbiterian droſſe which were amongſt you; and how he hath made you, and your Government, as that new Heaven, and new Earth, from, and unto which, the new Jeruſalem is to deſcend; the Lord being pleaſed to make this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Theatre on which he will begin to act his preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.

            <p>THat which I intend to you by way of Epiſtle, is humbly to deſire you to compare your paſt, and preſent condition, with that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> during their Aegyptian bondage, as alſo untill they had paſſed the flood <hi>Jordan,</hi> and pitched their tents in <hi>Gilgall,</hi> in the plaine of <hi>Jericho,</hi> which I take to be your now preſent condition; for proofe of which (ſubmitting to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgements) I ſhall give you ſome few hints (of many) by way of Simily, which I conceive will fitly parallel with our condition, from our bondage unto this preſent ſeaſon; in which Embleme, I ſhall reſemble their Aegypt, to our Antichriſtian ſlavery. 2. Our late King, to their <hi>Pharaoh. 3.</hi> The Monopoliſts, to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Task-maſters. 4. Our then Parliament, and Sinod, to their <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> (who were brethren in judgement) 5. The red Sea to Prelacy, through which we paſſed, and in which, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Hoſt was deſtroyed. 6. The Wilderneſſe, I take to be the various judgements amongſt us in point of Religion. 7. As their Hoſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or not marched, but as the cloudy pillar moved, no more did the Army under the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> command, but as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Commiſſion ordered them. 8. As their <hi>Aaron</hi> offended by making an Aegyptian Idol for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to worſhip, ſo likewiſe did our Sinod, by ſetting up their Presbitery, it being a limbe of that Antichriſt we are in bondage unto. 9. As their <hi>Moſes</hi> was called to mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> where he dyed, ſo was <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to the Parliament. 10. As <hi>Joſhua</hi> was appointed Commander of the Hoſt, before <hi>Moſes</hi> dyed, ſo was our preſent Generall choſen before <hi>Eſſex</hi> dyed. 11. As their <hi>Joſhua</hi> was not bound up to the motion of the cloudy Pillar, but was at liberty to march when, and where he pleaſed; ſo neither
<pb facs="tcp:115723:7"/> was our preſent Generell, tyed to obſerve the Parliaments order for his marches, or enterpriſes. 12. As their <hi>Joſhua</hi> did lead them over the flood <hi>Jordan,</hi> when it over-flowed all its bankes, ſo hath our <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or Generall, led us over the Jordan of Presbitery, even when the promoters of that Tenent, was in the greateſt hopes to have eſtabliſhed it.

The feare and dread which fell upon all the Kings of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and all the Kings of the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> that were round about them, <hi>ver. 1. 2.</hi> How the Lord is ſaid to put <hi>Joſhua</hi> in minde, of renewing the ancient Covenant of Circumciſion, made formerly to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ver. 2. 3.

Thrice Honoured Valiants, I ſhall take on me to minde you of ſomething, in relation to each of theſe particulars, as they parallel with our preſent condition.</p>
            <p>1. It is well knowne to the Camp of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> what the Lord hath done by us, and for us, whereof we rejoyce. And is it not alſo taken notice of in all the Kingdomes about us, how the Lord hath dryed up before us, the Euphrates of Papacy, the red Sea of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
<pb facs="tcp:115723:8"/> and the Jordan of Presbitery; as alſo how he hath deſtroyed our Aegyptian <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Hoſt. Yea, doth not all the Nations about us, exceedingly feare, and tremble; yea ſo, as that their hearts melt, yea is there any more ſpirit left in them?</p>
            <p>2. Have we not the Spirit of the Lord, at this very inſtant of time, putting us in minde to renew the ancient Sacraments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme, and the Lords Supper, anſwerable to their Circumciſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Paſchall Lambe?</p>
            <p>3. Ought not you the <hi>Joſhuas</hi> of our Hoſt, to be like obedient to the heavenly voyce, as the other?</p>
            <p>4. Is there not the like cauſe as was then? Have either your ſelves, or any other in the Congregation, been Baptized (during our wilderneſſe condition,) according to the primative practiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? Or hath the Sacrament of the Lords Supper been celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of late, according to the Apoſtles inſtitution? Yea, have not all the holy Ordinances been ſlighted, and contemned of us, ſince our Antichriſtian bondage? Have not all the poſterities ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> time periſhed in the Wilderneſſe, becauſe they obeyed not the voyce of the Lord in theſe particulars (unto whom he ſware that he would not ſhew them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which the Lord ſware unto their Fathers that he would give us, a Land flowing with Milke and Honey, upon which your feet now ſtandeth) I beſeech you therefore give the Lord cauſe (in this his day) to ſay unto you, as he did then to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> viz. that he hath rolled away the reproach of Antichriſt (in the uſe of his Ordinances) from amongſt us, (which have been ſo long abuſed, and ſlighted by us, even to this preſent day;) and then be you well aſſured, that you ſhall be fed with the old Corne, and fruit of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and your wilderneſſe Manna ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now to render Sir <hi>John,</hi> the Pariſh Prieſt, a reaſon why I have not fixed the Authors names to ſuch of the matter as hath been collected by me; 1. It was, becauſe I queſtioned whether they were their owne, from whom I had them. 2. Neither was it ever thought unlawfull to fight an enemy with his owne Weapon, being obtained; neither have I done any more in this, then by uſing the Prelates againſt the Papiſts, and the Presbiterian againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; by which conteſt of theirs, amongſt themſelves, Providence is wonderfully ſeene, in that like the <hi>Aſſirians,</hi> they helpe to ruine one another, ſo that my chiefe worke is to ſubdue that Hierarchy of Presbitery, who hath conquered the other two, and now would reigne it ſelfe in their ſtead. Againe, I would have ſuch Sir <hi>Johns</hi> to know, that to fight a publick enemy, requireth the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Magazine, both for offenſive, and defenſive Weapons; and ſeeing the Lord hath moved me to be his Churches Champion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that three-headed Monſter of the Pope, with his three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Hierarchies, of Papacy, Prelacy, and Presbitery, certainly he will allow me (as <hi>Saul</hi> did to <hi>David</hi>) his owne Armour; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that I may gather, ſuch materials as I ſhall thinke meet for the incounter (in ſuch common places) as <hi>David</hi> did in the Brook, which having gathered, I therewith advance in the ſpirit of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> towards that Zanzumim, or Gyganticall <hi>Annakim,</hi> hoping the Lord of Hoſts (the only giver of Battels) will ſo proſper the event, as that I ſhall, (as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Goliah</hi>) head him with his own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen Presbyters,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe reaſon why I have printed this ſheet, was becauſe (when my book was printed off) I hapned to meet with a book publiſhed by you, (titled, <hi>The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vindication of your Government and Miniſtry, &amp;c.</hi>) which in regard mine being to ſucceed, and not poſitively intended as an anſwer to yours, I thought it requiſite to write ſome what, whereby you may take notice that I have beene at the charge of one of them books (ſo publiſhed by you) to the end I might diſcover how farre providence had provided you of an anſwer to your thoughts, before they were either publiſhed, or penned: As alſo to take notice what that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Spirit (which is yet ſo predominant in you) had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated unto you, as a preparative for its own Ruine, and your perpetuall ſhame, and diſgrace. To which purpoſe, I have taken notice of ſome paſſages in your booke, which clearely tend to that purpoſe. As firſt, in that great over-ſight, <hi>in not proving you had a Church.</hi> Did you never heare that the Schiſmaticks and Hereticks (<hi>you ſo much gape to devoure</hi>) did as well op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>your Church,</hi> as your <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Minstry.</hi> Could you thinke they were now ſatisfied in the lawfulneſſe of it, more then formerly, <hi>viz. That the whole frame of it is Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb facs="tcp:115723:15"/> as alſo the appurtenances thereunto belonging.</hi> Certainly you thought your book would have hapned in the hands of none, but ſuch ſilly people you dedicated it unto, whom you have ſo long blinded by your <hi>Lucifer</hi>-like Luſtre, or <hi>Janes,</hi> and <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>-like deluſions: But if ſo, providence hath otherwiſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, to the end you might deceive them no longer. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, you would gladly now content your ſelves with them you have under your Churches, <hi>in London;</hi> but I hope they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ither more wit, or grace, then to be any longer deluded by you. And for the other Sectaries, &amp;c. they adjure you to beguile your auditors no longer with ſuch vaine pretences, and ſeeming ſhewes of the purity of your Church-government, and Miniſtry; but that you would prove them to be of ſuch like mettall, <hi>as you boaſt them to be.</hi> And that not only (as you have done) from your infallible tongues, pens, <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo,</hi> or from your old Grandam at <hi>Rome;</hi> but from the inſtitution of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, (<hi>not legall, or politick obſervations of the Jewes, &amp;c.</hi>) And untill you have ſo done, (whſch I am confident you will never doe) they are all fooles, or mad-men, that will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a conceit that you have either a true Church-Government, or Miniſtry. And therefore in the name of all ſuch as deſire to practiſe Religion in the primitive puritie thereof, I pronounce and declare, whatſoever you have ſaid in that booke, to be of no more eſteem, <hi>than a Caſtle built in the Aire, or a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell of confuſions.</hi> For where doe you find in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> a Church meerly compoſed of Officers, or any part of the Church, termed by the name of Laytie, or Lay-Elders, Lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c. Or where ſuch ſorts of people were admitted to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowſhip, as there was a need to examine them touching their faith before the receipt of the Lords Supper. Or where in any Act of Judicature, or advice, that the brethren were exempted from their vote, and conſent, or had not a joynt intereſt, and concurrence therein. Or where read you (there) of A Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Provinciall, or Nationall Synod, or Nationall Church, or of one ſort of Paſtors, that were Superiour to others, <hi>being of the ſame calling, whether mediate, or immediate.</hi> I might inſert many other things, but I conceive theſe few particulars will ſerve you billing at. In the next place, I obſerve your notable
<pb facs="tcp:115723:15"/> juggle, in that you would clearly put upon them whom you call Schiſmaticks, &amp;c as that they have abuſed, or ſlandered you, (<hi>with a matter of truth</hi>) and dealt with you, as the Old per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors dealt with the Chriſtians, by putting them into Bears<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins, and then baite them with dogs; or, as the Papiſts dealt with <hi>John Hus,</hi> when they painted a picture of a Red Devil upon his head, and then expoſed him to the laughter of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Gentlemen, <hi>this was never your owne practiſe, witneſſe the Mild and Modeſt books of your late Champion</hi> Edwards, <hi>&amp;c. And truly them that deale ſo with you, are too blame in being at ſuch paines about you, in regard your nature of it ſelfe is ſufficient to diſcover what you are, without ſuch Badges, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: And therefore you ſee I did not Muffle, or diſguiſe you in that Manner, in the Frontiſpeece, where I have alſo given my reaſon for it.</hi> After which your Prologue, you begin the Comedie, by rehearſing what they tax you with, which chiefly conſiſteth in theſe enſuing Particulars, which are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 1. As to be ſuch as are Lordly, and Domineering Men. <hi>But your Claſſicall, Provinciall, and Nationall Synod, argue the contrary.</hi> 2. Such as would Lord it over the people of God, more than ever the Prelates did. <hi>But the Act you procured to puniſh Schiſmes, &amp;c. Argueth the contrary; yea, the truth is, you have been, and yet would be, as Mild and Modeſt, as Wolvs or Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> 3. Such, as inſtead of one Biſhop, would have ſet up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds. <hi>But your fore-mentioned Synods argue the contrary.</hi> 4. Such as would erect A Tyrannicall and Cruell Government, had you power to eſtabliſh it. <hi>I ſhall want</hi> Rome <hi>to excuſe you in this particular.</hi> 5. Such as would Fine and Impriſon all, that would not yeeld unto your Church, and Government. <hi>Tuſh, the Afore-named Act doth cleare you in this particular.</hi> 6. Such as would erect an Arbitrary Power, and Challenge an unlimited Jurisdiction. <hi>But the thouſands of Pariſhes, ſubject to your Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Synod, doth clearly free you of Any ſuch purpoſe.</hi> 7. Such as would rob the Congregationall Churches of their power and liberty. <hi>But your Diſ-affection to Tithes, as alſo your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Such Churches, ſheweth the contrary.</hi> 8. Such as would not change <hi>domininum,</hi> but <hi>dominum. Doe you and the Prelats cleare this Scruple amongſt your ſelves.</hi> 9. Such as ſeek for
<pb facs="tcp:115723:16"/> unitie, but not for puritie. <hi>Your Nationall Church proveth it clearely (not) to be otherwiſe.</hi> 10. Such as will not aſſent A <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> but depend upon a <hi>Jus humanum. But your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Edicts and Injunctions ſhew the contrary.</hi> 11. Such as depend more upon an Ordinance of Parliament, than an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. <hi>Tuſh, the Afore-mentioned Ordinance cleareth you.</hi> 12. Such as are the Only troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinderers of a Bleſſed Reformation. <hi>Witneſſe your late book Againſt the preſent Government, to the Contrary.</hi> 13. Such as are Peſtilent fellowes, and Movers of Sedition. <hi>Are they ſuch Mr.</hi> Lilly? 14. Such as are Pulpit Incendiaries. <hi>Witneſſe your Billingsgate divinitie, quoted by Mr.</hi> Lilly, <hi>to the Contrary.</hi> 15. Such as have ſeparated their Conſecrated lungs, to blow up the fire of A ſecond Warre. <hi>I ſhould have ſaid A third, ſhould I not Mr.</hi> Lilly, 16.

            <p>Firſt, in that it is ſaid, <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God and the Firmament ſheweth His handy Work Pſa.</hi> 19. From which words, I thus argue, <hi>That which God declareth, or manifeſteth, ought to be obſerved by them, to whom they are manifeſted unto;</hi> But they are declared or manifeſted unto ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures, as men, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be demanded, how they declare, or ſhew ſuch things.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, By their <hi>illumination, and influences,</hi> the one is made good to us <hi>by their glorius Splendour,</hi> and the other <hi>by their powerfull influence, or effects,</hi> which are alſo made out unto us by the ebbing and flowing of the Waters, or in mad people (<hi>ſuch as the Presbyterians, whoſe finall exit Mr.</hi> Lilly <hi>ſaith will jump with the laſt quarter of the Moon.</hi>) Now as theſe obſervations requireth an <hi>obſerver;</hi> ſo the obſerver requireth <hi>a judgement in the thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi> and judgement is obtained by <hi>practice, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115723:17"/>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>It is lawfull to ſtudy and practice Aſtrologie as any other Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If that Text of <hi>Iſay</hi> 47. 12. 13. &amp;c. be objected.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Them Texts are ſpoken of ſuch <hi>as depend upon the Aſpects of Starres, and confide in their Influences, as inevitable cauſes of joy, or ſorrow.</hi> But ſhall we therefore reject a thing <hi>that is lawfull in it ſelfe,</hi> becauſe ſome people abuſe it? Becauſe Papiſts give Almes by way of Merit, ſhall we therefore give none at all? Becauſe Ordinances are ſlighted by ſome, and Adored by others, ſhall we therefore deſpiſe them?</p>
            <p>Again, if the Presbyterians look well unto themſelvs, <hi>they will be found the very Sorcerers, &amp;c.</hi> for that Prophecie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth unto <hi>Rome,</hi> of which they are <hi>Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be demanded, what good is got by the knowledge of <hi>Aſtrology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, It is the ſame to the outward or externall man, as Divinity to the inward or internall. And therefore as a man doth labour to know the minde of God (by ſtudying the Scriptures) in relation to his ſoule: So may he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the other, in relation to the preſervation of his body.</p>
            <p>Againe, He that is well read in Aſtrology, hath theſe advantages above other men.</p>
            <p>As to know the Inclinations of the Heavens towards him, which if he diſcerne to be good, it will, or at leaſt ought, to procure thankfulneſſe in him to the Creator of that meanes by which he obtaineth that knowledge; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſtirre him up to a pious life and converſation, leſt he ſhould be deprived of that good <hi>portended unto him,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he knoweth, <hi>they are not ſo irrevocably fixed,</hi> but that his ſinnes may divert his enjoyment of them.</p>
            <p>2. If they preſage evill towards him, he is alſo thereby ſtirred up to petition the diſpoſer of ſuch events, that they may be diverted from him; ſo that there can no harme happen by the knowledge of Aſtrology, <hi>to a Beleever,</hi> but rather, <hi>much good.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115723:17"/>
            <p>If it be demanded whether we may or ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, or depend upon Aſtrologie, or Aſtrologers? I anſwer, that we ought to have reſpect to them, as we have to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who by Symptomes doth diſcover the condition of thy body, as alſo will tell thee that God hath ordained ſuch and ſuch hearbs, &amp;c. for the healing of thy infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp;c.

               </gap> thee, <hi>becauſe he telleth thee ſo;</hi> for a Believer knoweth, that God is able to divert the operations of ſuch things, as in their proper natures <hi>are good for us.</hi> So is it in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the Aſtrologer diſcovereth unto us the Predictions of the Heavenly Bodies, telleth us ſuch and ſuch things ſeemes to be intended by the Creator, (in regard he diſcovereth them by the Conjunction and operations of the Heavens;) yet are we not poſitively bound to beleeve that they ſhall ſo come to paſſe: We ought therefore to confide in neither, as ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to depend upon them, neither are we to reject them.</p>
            <p>Againe, we are not bound abſolutely to depend upon ſuch as teach Divinity, and yet the Profeſſion is lawfull; and ſo of any other Art, or Science. But yet where experience teacheth us, that a man is <hi>an able Divine, Phyſitian, &amp;c.</hi> we ought to confide in them, <hi>more</hi> then in others of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or Science.

            <p>I anſwer, That I take Mr. <hi>Lilly (if he be of the aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned judgement)</hi> to be a <hi>better Aſtrologer then a Divine,</hi> for otherwiſe he would not have given <hi>ſo dubious a conſtruction of that paſſage.</hi> I deſire therefore he would <hi>more fully am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfie his judgement in that particular.</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:115723:18"/>
            <p>As to what he hath predicted againſt the Presbyterian Government, and the prefixed time he hath ſet down, as <hi>A full period to it,</hi> time will make manifeſt; but as to my own particular, I am fully ſatisfied, that it will be as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually accompliſhed, <hi>as he hath ſaid it,</hi> (unleſſe it be upheld, more out of obſtinacy, then Affection.) Yet I am verily perſwaded that God hath endued that man with a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above other of his Science, to the end he may diſcover how the Stars in their Courſes fight againſt all that oppoſe the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt, under what form, or notion ſoever, I ſhall therefore add one queſtion more to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Sinnod, in Mr. <hi>Lillies</hi> behalf, (whoſe Perſon and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they ſo much vilifie) which I deſire they would ſatisfie me in, <hi>viz.</hi> How, or by what manner, <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barack (Iudg.</hi> 5. 20.) knew that <hi>Siſera,</hi> was fought againſt from Heaven, or by the Stars in their courſes (if not by their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.)

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>4. <hi>Inſt.</hi> Neither did the <hi>Lord</hi> look upon us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us his people, for any <hi>worthineſſe in us,</hi> but for his <hi>owne mercies ſake,</hi> he hath <hi>called us</hi> to the knowledge of his truth; for otherwiſe what we are in our ſelves, the Apoſtle <hi>ſheweth</hi> out of the fourteenth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>that they are all gone aſtray, &amp;c. there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then it is <hi>moſt evident</hi> that Gods election <hi>changeth not,</hi> but<note place="margin">Good workes is no precedent cauſe, but a conſequent ef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> whatſoever he hath <hi>decreed</hi> concerning any mans Salvation ſhall ſtand, <hi>for the gift and calling of God are without repentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 29.

It is evident, that all that were before Chriſt, as alſo ſince Chriſt, <hi>are by nature the children of wrath;</hi> for if we obſerve, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of the time paſt, viz. <hi>before Chriſts comming in the fleſh,</hi> and ſo ſaith, <hi>we</hi> were <hi>the children of wrath;</hi> but he ſpeaketh of the time preſent, for he ſaith, <hi>We are all by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the children of wrath;</hi> intimating that the Paſſion of Chriſt as it was an Act, viz. by the thing <hi>done</hi> did <hi>not</hi> cleanſe us (<hi>though under the Goſpel</hi>) from originall ſinne or corruption of the fleſh, for that is <hi>only done by faith in his blood;</hi> for as the Sacraments doe not confirme grace, <hi>Ex opera operato,</hi> by the thing <hi>done,</hi> the ſame is in the ſacrificing of himſelf for the ſins of the world.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo confirmed by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 19. where he ſaith, <hi>Out of the heart proceedeth evill thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the imaginations, purpoſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the heart of man are evill, and that continually,</hi> or from day to day, even from the day of his birth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>

                     <p>1.

Cum quem,</hi> with whom the ſinne is <hi>committed;</hi> as fornication betwixt them that are <hi>married,</hi> is more hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous then betwixt <hi>ſingle perſons. 7. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> where, in what <hi>place</hi> it is committed; for it is more heynous to ſteale in a <hi>Church,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Gods people, then in <hi>another place. 8. quando,</hi> when, for it is more heynous to <hi>ſteale</hi> in time of <hi>Divine worſhip,</hi> then at other times. 9. <hi>Ad quid,</hi> to what end; for the <hi>end</hi> maketh a thing of it ſelf lawfull or unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>Now to make an <hi>action</hi> lawfull or good, all theſe things muſt concurre; but it is enough to make it evill, if it faile in <hi>any of them;</hi> and this <hi>faultineſſe</hi> of the <hi>action,</hi> paſſeth with the <hi>action it ſelfe,</hi> which is the ſubiect thereof, and remaineth not.</p>

                     <p>The firſt of theſe is <hi>coactive,</hi> the ſecond is <hi>voluntary;</hi> the firſt neither <hi>juſtifieth</hi> a man if he doe well, being forced thereunto, nor <hi>condemneth</hi> him if he doe evill, but the ſecond hath place in both; for by it the righteous have praiſe (whoſe obedience in reſpect of <hi>Gods ordinance</hi> is neceſſary, and infallable;) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the <hi>wicked</hi> are condemned, who ſinne <hi>willingly,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (Gods preſience conſidered) in <hi>ſome ſort,</hi> it is alſo neceſſary. As our Saviour ſaid concerning <hi>Judas, It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that offences ſhould come, but woe be to him by whom they come,</hi> Mat. 18. 7. It was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the determinate counſell and fore-knowledge of God,</hi> Act. 2. 23. but <hi>Judas</hi> did not know that he was appointed to <hi>be the man</hi> that ſhould <hi>act that treaſon,</hi> but he did it <hi>voluntarily,</hi> out of his covetous affection <hi>to money,</hi> as doth evidently appeare by his owne expreſſions, <hi>What will ye give me and I will betray him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> Mat. 26. 14.</p>
                     <p>Again, it was neceſſary that the Prophets and Wiſe men ſhould be <hi>killed,</hi> crucified, ſcurged, and perſecuted by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as Chriſt had foretold, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 34. but nevertheleſſe the <hi>Jewes</hi> did it out of a voluntary hatred they had to Chriſt, and his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as plainly appeareth in Scripture.</p>

                     <p>Obj. <hi>THe contrary may be argued in theſe two reſpects; 1. In that it is to be conſidered who are the Authors of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, God or man; If by man the puniſhment be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it is in the loſſe only of temporall things, as of poſſeſſions, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, honours, &amp;c. for the tranſgreſſions of their Parents; as by humane Lawes, treaſon againſt the State or Common-wealth, is puniſhed with death in the Offendor; and loſſe of honour and goods in their poſterities. But the puniſhment of death cannot be inflicted upon the children for their fathers offence, as a rule is given in</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:115723:75"/> Deut. 24. 16. <hi>The Father ſhall not be put to death for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor the Children for the Father.</hi>

                     <p>2. <hi>If the puniſhment be inflicted of the Lord, it is either eternall or temporall; now eternall puniſhment is laid upon none but the party that ſinneth, the ſoule that ſinneth ſhall dye. If it be tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, it either conſiſteth in ſome temporall benefit, or of life. If the firſt, not only little ones and infants, but even they which are of yeares, ſhall ſuffer for their Fathers ſins; as the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>did beare the iniquities of their Fathers forty yeares in the Wilderneſſe, and the</hi> Jewes <hi>great and ſmall, were afflicted in the</hi> Babiloniſh <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. But where the puniſhment of temporall death is decreed by the Lord, there only, the infants are puniſhed for their Fathers ſins, as the children of the rebellious</hi> Corah, Dathan, <hi>and</hi> Abiram <hi>were ſwallowed up with their Fathers; the greater ſort alſo periſhed in that deſtruction, but then they were ſuch as conſented thereunto.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan <hi>alſo was puniſhed with his Sons and Daughters for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by him committed, which was done for the greater deteſtation of the fact, and the examples of others, theſe are the two Arguments which the Popiſh Writers uſe for the vindicating of this their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may be thus anſwered.</hi>

                     <p>We are alſo <hi>commanded</hi> by God himſelf, that we ſhould ſweare<note place="margin">We ought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſweare by the name of God.</note> only by his name, <hi>Deut. 6. 13.

                     <p n="2">2. God reprooveth thoſe that ſweare by any other then by him, as <hi>Zep. 1. 5. I will cut off him that worſhip and ſweare by the Lord, and</hi> Malcham.</p>

                        <hi>Ergo</hi> in the ſame caſe ought we to become more carefull how we admit of Children, whoſe faith, and actions doth not yet appeare.</p>
                     <p>2. The example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles in gathering of that Church out of <hi>Judiſme,</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſme,</hi> ought to be our patterne now to imitate.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo</hi> to Baptize Infants, is a way never to compoſe ſuch a Church of Beleevers, as was in the Apoſtles time.</p>

Now Chriſtian friends, I beſeech you conſider ſeriouſly in what a condition you are now in, for to deſtroy this Temple, is really to deſtroy your ſelues, both in Body, and Sovle; for if you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime your bodies to be materials of that fore-mentioned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, or Temple, it moſt of conſequence follow, that you alſo diſclaime Chriſt, who hath his reſidence there; for as the Spirit of a Saint is included in his naturall body, ſo is Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Spirit, by which they are made one; but you by diſclaiming your bodies, to be of that Temple, doe thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive your ſpirits, of the Spirit of Chriſt; and he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, &amp;c. And if not Chriſts, who doe you belong unto, if not to Satan? True, I doe acknowledge moſt of your bodies to be Temple proofe, fit ſtones to be put into the fabrick; but know, that ſo long as you lye in ſuch diſtinct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Song-man, and Muſician, will tell you, it was firſt by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Gam-ut, and ſo on to other Muſicall proportions; the ſtrong man, will you, it was firſt by breaſt Milke, &amp;c. by which he gained his ſtrength. But yet none of theſe before mentioned, will deſpiſe their ſmall beginnings, or are ſo ignorant, as to think any other can come to the like knowledge, or ſtrength, by any other meanes; however they will acknowledge them to be the naturall, or moſt uſefull meanes to attaine ſuch knowledge, or ſtrength. Therefore albeit you think your ſelves ſtrong men in Chriſt, and can digeſt the ſtrong meat of the Word, and have the Spirituall, or Logicall knowledge of the Scriptures, of the hidden or deep ſecreets of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and are able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the height, and depth of the Scriptures, yet doubtleſſe you are not ignorant that there are alſo babes in Chriſt, <hi>which ſtand in need of the Word, that they may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. and that you your ſelves were ſometimes ſuch. Deſpiſe not therefore the meanes, by which you have attained to your preſent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and by which you have been nouriſhed up to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtature in Chriſt. Reject not therefore the letter of the Scriptures, or the Ordinances of hearing the Word, or receiving the Sacraments; experienced <hi>Paul</hi> could tell you, that he had not knowne ſin but by the letter of the Law. And Chriſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth us, <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>they teſtifie of him, Joh.</hi> 5. 39. The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> alſo ſaith, that <hi>he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to God, muſt firſt know that God is,</hi> Heb. 6. 1. &amp;c. we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taught, that <hi>the Scriptures were written for our inſtruction,</hi> Rom. 15. 4. yea we are admoniſhed to be mindfull of thoſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which the Prophets and Apoſtles have written, as to a ſure word of truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. &amp;c. Now whereunto tendeth all theſe exhortations, if the letter of the Scriptures be of no uſe? The like may be alſo ſaid of the Word preached, and of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:115723:194"/> Wherefore was it that the Apoſtles uſed ſuch meanes to build up Saints in the holy faith, or why are ſuch preſidents of their left upon record, unleſſe we ſhould receive them, as preſidents to imitate?</p>

I ſay, if theſe Ordinances be not to be practiſed by the now Chriſtians, who are they preſcribed, you will reply, they were requiſite for them times, which were only ſhadowes of theſe, but now God will burne up all ſuch droſſe in his Church.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, though the Lord hath promiſed to burne up all the droſſe in his Church, yet hath he not therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to burne up his Church with them. Againe, every ſhadow hath its ſubſtance, and every ſubſtance its ſhadow; and albeit theſe Ordinances be as the ſhell to the kernel, yet muſt the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel have its ſhell to ripen in, or it will never increaſe to its matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. If you can deny Chriſt a Church Militant, you may alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the uſe of Ordinances; but the Holy Ghoſt hath, and doth manifeſt, that the fleſhly tabernacles of the Saints, are his Temple, (as I have ſhewed;) therefore ſo long as there ſhall be Saints upon earth, ſo long wil Chriſt have a Church Militant; which Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church can no more ſubſiſt without Ordinances, then a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in a dead body. You wil reply, we are not attained to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and therefore for us to make uſe of Ordinances, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine today the foundation of Repentance from dead workes, and of faith towards God. My anſwer is, Albeit you have much knowledge in the ſecrets of God, yet are you not compoſed all of Spirit, you have as wel a carnall part, as a Spirituall part. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> found in himſelfe, as well the Law of the Fleſh, as of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 33. &amp;c. which fleſhly ſubſtance you are to conforme to ſuch Ordinances, which Chriſt hath inſtituted in his Church Militant, whilſt you are Members thereof. True it is, Antichriſt hath polluted them (as much as lay in him) both in the doctrinall, and traditionall pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115723:195"/> aſſiſtance I have much, if not altogether purged, and cleared, from their Antichriſtian droſſe, and reduced them to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative purity, (out of that maſſe of corruption they were invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in.) To which Lawes, and Ordinances of your Maſter Chriſt, I hope you wil yeeld a willing ſubjection, by incorporating your ſelves into Bodies Politick, by that rule which Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for that purpoſe, viz. by the gate of Baptiſme, it being the externall meanes to iniſiate you into the externall profeſſion of Chriſt in his Church Militant, your perſons being as wel to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the outward Government thereof, as your Spirits to the inward.</p>
            <p>Againe, as in humane learning, he that would be made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, muſt firſt attaine to <hi>three degrees of knowledge, viz. a good Gramarian, a Rethoriſſian, and a Logiſſian.</hi> ſo is it in <hi>Spirituall knowledg,</hi> to which there are alſo <hi>three degrees</hi> to be attained, before one can be formed <hi>a compleat Chriſtian,</hi> viz. the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the old teſtament and the new teſtament, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual interpretation thereof. And it is worthy of our beſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to conſider the <hi>Mutuall Harmony</hi> of the Scriptures, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this Spirituall knowledge as aforeſaid. For in relation to this threefold knowledg, we have <hi>a Trinity of perſons in the Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which co-opperate with them, and are agreeable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to them.

In that there is ſaid to be no Temple in it, is meant, that there ſhall not be a materiall one, conſiſting of wood, ſtone, and gold, as was in that of Jeruſalem, built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the reaſon thereof followeth; viz. becauſe the Lord God Almighty, and the Lambe are the Temple of it; that is, it doth conſiſt of Saints, in whom the Lambe Chriſt is ever preſent; as alſo in that he hath opened Heaven in every place to faithful Beleevers. 4. In that it is ſaid to need no light of the Sunne, or Moone, to ſhine in it, is meant, of Eccleſiaſticall, or civill Government, as now practiſed; having its proper power, and adornment in it ſelfe, viz. from Chriſt; and his Apoſtles. 5. In that the Nations which are ſaved, is ſaid to walke in the light of it, is meant, that all ſuch who are ordained to eternall life, ſhall be conformable to the government of it, in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline. 6. In that the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſaid to bring their glory, and honour unto it, is meant, that the Kings, and Rulers of the earth, ſhall hate Antichriſt, in each of his Hierarchies, and deſtroy it in their dominions; as alſo willingly lay downe their owne powers, and become loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to Jeſus Chriſt. 7. In that the gates of the City, are not
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:115723:196"/> ſaid to be ſhut, either by day, or by night, and yet none is to enter therein, that is uncleane, &amp;c. but ſuch as are written in the Lambs Book of Life, is meant, that all manner of people may have recourſe to the Churches of the Saints, to heare the Word. As Country-men may have leave to come into a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> City for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, which admiſſion into the City, doth not make them Free-men, in regard they are not inrolled in their Records; ſo in like manner albeit the men of the world, may have liberty to heare the Word preached amongſt the Saints, yet they are not thereby made members of their Society, not being entred, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled a Saint in the Churches Records, viz. not being incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Baptiſme into their Society, or Body Politick. 8. In that a cleare and pure River of water is ſaid to proceed out of the Throne of God, and of the Lambe, is meant of the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, which ſhall be poured upon the Saints, who ſhall be taught of God. 9. In that it is ſaid to run through the mideſt of the ſtreets of the City, is meant, that the aforeſaid Spirit ſhall be free for each Member of the Church to make uſe of, as well one as other. 10. In that on each ſide of the River, is ſaid to grow a tree of Life, bearing twelve manner of fruits, and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her fruit every month, and the leaves being for the healing of the Nations, is meant, that the Goſpel ſhall flouriſh, and ſpread it ſelfe, into all Countries, by vertue whereof they ſhall be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the leproſie of Antichriſtianiſme, Judiſme and Heatheniſm: Thus have I briefly diſcovered unto you, the new, or Spirituall Jeruſalem, hoping you will be willing <hi>in this day of Chriſts power,</hi> to give up your ſelves as a free-will offering unto him, by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto his Kingly Government; but I muſt tell you, that at the preſent there is very ſmall hopes of it, in regard of your now condition, which if I be not miſtaken in (as ſure I am not) may fitly be paralleld with theſe places of Scripture; I ſhall firſt inſtance in that of <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 38. where our Saviour told his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>that their ſpirits was willing, but their fleſh was weake;</hi> even ſo it is with you, for you are awake in the Spirit, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe in the body; you are awake in the ſpirituall worſhip of Chriſt, viz. you have the ſpirit of Prayer, and Propheſie, but you are aſleep in the body, or formall part of it. 2.

Is not your ſpirits out of the body afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned? have you not walked through dry places, viz. out of all formes of Goſpel Fellowſhip? have you not ſought reſt, and finde none? viz. Have you not laboured to ſettle your ſelves in ſeverall formes, witneſſe the great Diſputes that have been about Church Government; and have you found reſt in any of them? Againe, hath not that ſpirit of yours, (being out of the body) taken unto it ſelfe ſeven Spirits, worſe then it ſelfe, ſince it departed out of the true Body of the primative Church? witneſſe Papacy, Prelacy, Presbitery, Independancy, Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Univerſalians, Seekers, &amp;c. and in ſo doing, hath not your laſt eſtate, been worſe then your firſt?

            <p>My firſt obſervation is, in relation of your going forth to meet the Bride-groome, which implyeth that you were (once,) both of one Family, or Church Fellowſhip together (if you could have kept you ſo) in the Primative, or Apoſtolicall times; ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what you have got by your gadding. You could not have kept you within doores, you muſt (with <hi>Dinah</hi>) goe to ſee the Daughters of the Land, though in the attempt you be raviſhed by the Antichriſtian <hi>Shechem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In relation to their ſlumbering and ſleeping, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I finde you alſo as deeply ingaged as the fooliſh; for like as they doe place Religion in the externall forme thereof, as in the very uſe of the Ordinances, or due obſervation of them, as to heare the Word preached, and to receive the Sacraments; the performance of which duties, they conceive is as much as God requireth of them, in his worſhip and ſervice. In reference to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115723:197"/> which I ſay, <hi>ye are wiſe,</hi> for that ye know that ſuch things are but the out-ſide of <hi>Religion,</hi> and that it is a ſpirituall worſhip which Chriſt requireth of the Saints; yet nevertheleſſe in this particular, you are ſlumbring, and ſleeping, as well as they, viz. by your diſpitefull contempt of the externall ordinances, of the externall, or militant Church, it being with you in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as it is with ſuch ſorts of people, who becauſe Papiſts give Almes in a plentifull meaſure, <hi>ſuppoſing they merit thereby,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they wil give <hi>none at all,</hi> becauſe they wil not incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3. In this your ſlumbring, and ſleeping condition, you are ſaid to be out of the Marriage Chamber, both of you lying before the doore, as may be gathered from the tenth verſe, which is as much as plainly to tell you, that you are both out of the payle of the Church.</p>
            <p>4. In that you are ſaid to take oyle in your veſſels, with your Lamps, and not the other, is meant that you have a Spirituall principle reſiding in you, viz. of Prayer and Prophecy, which the other want, they relying meery upon humane Learning, (as doth appeare by their preaching, ſet formes of Prayer, and their other Ceremonies) in their worſhip, and ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>3.

<pb facs="tcp:115723:197"/> worſhip (in their ſence of them) being by this Treatice proved rediculous, ſhall burne it ſelfe out of the affections of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſuch Teachers, viz. of the Papall, Prelaticall, and Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Clergy. As for the reſt of that Parable before, or after, I referre you to the interpretation of the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Braine,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the Lord hath been pleaſed to reveale more of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, then to any of the now Clergy in the whole world; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his ſeverall Evangelicall predictions, of what is now appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently made manifeſt, to the eyes of all men. I ſhall only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one particular more, wherein you are prefigured, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. where it is ſaid, <hi>that the Woman had two wings of a great Eagle given unto her, that ſhe might fly into the wilderneſſe, into her place; where ſhe is nouriſhed, for a time, times, and halfe a time, from the face of the Serpent;</hi> the meaning of which I take to be this. By the <hi>Woman</hi> I underſtand the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the <hi>Serpent</hi> Antichriſt; the wings there ſaid to be given to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, (whereby ſhe fled into the wilderneſſe) I take to be the two Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> by which ſhe hath been ſupported, as upon the wings of that great <hi>Eagle</hi> Chriſt Jeſus; and in that ſhe is ſaid to be preſerved in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, for a time, and times, and halfe a time, I take it to be this. That the <hi>Annabaptiſticall Church</hi> (which I take to be the Church there ſpoke of) hath, and ſhall have its abode, in its now wilderneſſe condition, until <hi>Papacy</hi> ſhall be aboliſhed, (which I referre unto the word <hi>time</hi>) as alſo until <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and <hi>Presbitery,</hi> ſhall be alſo exterpated (which I apply to the word <hi>times</hi>) as alſo until ſuch as you, ſhall <hi>relinquiſh your groſſe errors,</hi> and <hi>back-ſlidings,</hi> (which I take to be intimated, by the <hi>halfe times</hi>) Now the reaſon why I ſo alude them is this, viz. <hi>Papacy</hi> I compare <hi>to time,</hi> becauſe of its long reſidence in this Nation, <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and <hi>Presbitery,</hi> to <hi>times,</hi> in regard that they both (as it were) made up <hi>a time,</hi> (viz. as long a continuance as Papacy had) amongſt us. And <hi>your time,</hi> to the <hi>halfe time,</hi> there mentioned, in regard, it (as it were) maketh up <hi>halfe ſo long a time</hi> (as one of the former times) ſince you firſt began to ſlight or reject Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; now I ſay, during this <hi>time, times,</hi> and <hi>halfe time,</hi> viz. until you all returne to your <hi>fathers houſe,</hi> and recover your <hi>firſt love,</hi> you are no better then part of that <hi>Serpent,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:115723:198"/> purſueth and perſecuteth the Church, and ſo conſequently, an enemy to Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude with a word of exhortation, Deare friends, conſider of what ſpirit yee are of; you are not ignorant that ſlumbring and ſleeping ſpirits, are wandring, and diſtempered ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirits, ſuch as conceive themſelves to be, <hi>what they are not,</hi> and <hi>where they are not,</hi> full of imaginarie fancies, ariſing from the humor, which is predominant in the body, in which ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have their recedence; and hath it not been clearly proved, that you are one, and the ſame with ſuch, have not each of your ſocieties fancied your ſelves, to be of the true Millitant church of Chriſt, and doth it now appeare you are ſo; can you be a free <hi>Denizon</hi> of a City, and not intol'd in their Records to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, can you be free of the new Jeruſalem, and your name not recorded in the Lambs booke of life; have you not alſo concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your ſelves, to be incorporated materialls with which that Temple is compoſed and doth it not now appear, that you are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a company of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ude heapes, out of the building; and hath it not been proved that your phantaſtick ſpirits alſo have had many ſtrange and unheard of dreames, and fancies dureing this your ſlumbering and ſleeping conditions. Be not therefore (I humbly intreate you) any longer deceived, or deluded, by ſuch ſpiritts; but trie each of your ſpirits by the touchſtone of truth, and withall be you well aſſured that Chriſt is not divided, either in body, or ſpirit. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 4. And therefore of neceſſitie, you muſt firſt become members of that one body, (I have diſcovered unto you) before you can have that onenes of ſpirit with it, for the body of neceſſitie muſt firſt be, before it can retaine a ſpirit, therefore ſo long as you are ſeperated from communion, and fellowſhip with the true body, you cannot be poſſeſſed by the true ſpirit. And from hence hath beene the rice of all the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of ſpirits now amongſt you, namely, in that you are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into one body; for every contrary body, or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, hath alſo a contrary ſpirit, peculier unto it, for ſuch as is the body, ſuch is the ſpirit, and the ſpirit of true diſcipline, doth loath to inhabit in a poluted body. Conſider therefore, how you are yet diſlocated from that body, to which properly you doe belong; and ſtrive to accompliſh that propheſie fore-mentioned,
<pb facs="tcp:115723:198"/> which relateth to your own perticular) by uniting &amp; incorporating your ſelves, with the yet reproachfull, and ſcandalous ſocietie of <hi>Annabaptiſts,</hi> who are really members of that true body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt Jeſus is the head, and by ſo doing, you will bocome a fit receptacle for that ſpirit, which is peculierly converſant with, and in that body, yea ſo you will become one with Chriſt, both in body and ſpirit. And being ſuch, yee ſhall enter with him into the marriage chamber. viz. be incorporated free <hi>Denizens</hi> of the ſpirituall Jeruſalem, by being inrol'd in the Lambs booke of life. Whereas the other before mentioned, ſhall be ſhut out, and put to crie; Lord, Lord open unto us. &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is diſcourſed at larg by that worthy man before mentioned, to whom I haue refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you. Thus leaving your thoughts to the guidance of the ſpirit of truth, which is able to direct you into all truth, as alſo that the ſerious conſideration thereof, will ſo undeceive the hearts of you, and all other (ordained to eternall life) as to ſet them free from ſuch deluſive ſpirits, which hath; and doth yet inſlave them, (even to the hight of impiety,) as alſo to make you, them, and us, one in Chriſt Jeſus, who is the head of his Church, is the heartie deſire of him, who hath thus earneſtly contended for your eternall felicity in the heaven of heavens.
